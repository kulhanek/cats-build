# A push operation (02.push-code) is performed on all repositories (by default)
# or on repositories listed in the 'repositories.push' file. This file should 
# be created by users who do not have a push access to all github repositories.
# Its syntax is the same as for the 'repositories' file. The easiest way how to 
# setup correctly the push operation is to make a copy of the 'repositories' 
# file as 'repositories.push' and then keep lines with repositories you have
# push access into. Since 'repositories.push' contains a setup per user, 
# it should not be commited and pushed into the master github repository and
# that is the resason why it is included in .gitignore.
